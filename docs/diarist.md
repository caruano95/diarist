I've been thinking about diaries since I saw that [Loretta](https://youtu.be/6xSxXiHwMrg) Google Superbowl Commercial (If you haven't seen it, go do that now, it's really good).
And of course, once the game was over my first instinct was to `!youtube how to write a diary`[[1]](#1) which did lead to some [awesome examples](https://youtu.be/fPkPesz-t_Q).

However, trying to write every single day turned out to be way to much for me, specially when I tried to make it pretty like those youtube videos, so I just gave up.

This was the case until about April 10, when I read about the hackathon. I was mostly interested in whatsapp so I started thinking for project ideas:
* Maybe some kind of image recognition app: You take a picture of an insect, whatsapp it to a number and it responds with the name of the animal! How cool would that be?
* Maybe a notification system for small businesses? I order my lunch from a small shop everyday and they always text me when the delivery guy arrives
* Maybe you could just take notes on whatsapp !

Of course the third one sounded the easiest, but I'm sure all professors and coworkers around the world would hate me if that ever became popular, so I thought maybe something more personal would work best.

### Why is this so much better than an app or an old-fashioned notebook ?

Well, I ask myself the same thing and came up with basically this two reasons:
* A common recommendation when starting a diary is to [write as if you were writing to a friend](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/diary-journal.html), so what if the platform you used was the very same one ?
* You don't have to install anything, it's just a number you text ("It's just a number" might become my tagline)

# What was your process for building this?

At first I wasn't sure of what I wanted, so I started doodling on this ipad app [Concepts](https://concepts.app/en/).

I actually loved that, I don't think the designers had software layouts in mind when they created the app but it's such a joy to use that I created my first "draft" of the website there.

You can see this in the [layout.pdf](https://github.com/caruano95/diarist/blob/master/docs/layout.pdf) file in the repo docs if you are interested (As a bonus, it has a picture of "Lola", our old office dog)

Once I had a more clear idea I started looking at Twilio's examples and I found this [Appointment reminders](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/tutorials/appointment-reminders-java-spark) java spark app which seemed like a good baseline to build the project on top off.


### What's next for the Diarist app ?
Good question! I have some things I want to do even if just for myself, but we'll see what the future brings. Some of those are ideas are the following (If you want to collaborate or have more ideas I would appreciate the input)

* Custom
